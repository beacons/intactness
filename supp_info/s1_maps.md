# Intactness and Cumulative Disturbance Datasets Used in Analysis

Revised: 2020-06-10



## Introduction

Intactness and disturbance datasets are increasingly used by conservation planners to design and evaluate protected areas. This page describes several freely available global and regional datasets that measure intactness (e.g., intact forest landscapes) or cumulative disturbances (e.g., human footprint maps) and which covers most or all of the the boreal region of North America.



## Intactness datasets



### Global Intact Forest Landscapes (2000, 2013, 2016)

The global Intact Forest Landscapes maps describe large unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems for the years 2000, 2013 and 2016 within areas of current forest extent, without signs of significant human activity, and having an area of at least 500 km2. The forest zone boundary was defined using a global tree canopy cover dataset (MODIS 500m) and included all areas with a tree canopy cover &gt; 20% in the year 2000. The global IFL maps were created using maps of human settlements and transportation networks and a global coverage of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (Landsat 5 & 7, 30m).

### Frontier Forests (1996)

The Forest Frontiers map was the first attempt to create a global map of the remaining large, ecologically intact, and relatively undisturbed natural forest landscapes. The map shows where the last remaining large areas of forest remains and provides an assessment of the degree of threat (low or no threat, medium or high threat, unassessed for threat). The maps were created from readily-accessible, but variable, ancillary information such as roads, and numerous experts provided advice and reviews. Unlike the other more recent approaches, Frontier Forests did not use consistent and more recent data sources such as satellite imagery. The Forest Frontiers map was published in 1997 by World Resources Institute.

### Canada Intact Forest Landscapes (2000, 2013)

The Intact Forest Landscapes maps (CIFL 2000 and CIFL 2013; ) depict Canada's remaining forest landscape fragments for the years 2000 and 2013. The datasets use specified size thresholds of 5,000 hectares for boreal regions and 1,000 hectares for temperate forest regions. The map was produced using (i) existing datasets describing major anthropogenic changes/disturbances (e.g., roads, other linear features, reservoirs) to exclude large areas influenced by human activities and (ii) satellite imagery (Landsat 5 and 7, 30m) to identify finer scale anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., cutblocks, cutlines) within candidate intact forest landscapes.

## Cumulative disturbance datasets



### Human Footprint (1993, 2009)

Human Footprint data are a standardized measure of cumulative human pressures on the environment that take into account the extent of built environments, crop land, pasture land, human population density, night-time lights, railways, roads and navigable waterways15. The Human Footprint ranges between values of 0 and 50, calculated at a 1 km2 resolution across the Earth’s terrestrial surface. Land can be considered human-dominated rather than ‘natural’ using a Human Footprint value threshold of 4 or greater22; a value of 0 is equivalent to no detectable human pressures of the type incorporated in the index. Human Footprint maps for 1993 and 2009 were downloaded from the Dryad Digital Repository49. It has been used to measure and classify habitat degradation22, connectivity for species50, global wilderness decline23 and the extent of human influence on protected areas51.

The Human Footprint maps measures the human influence on the earth's land surface in terms of a Human Influence Index (HII) normalized by biome and realm. Human Footprint values range from 1 to 50. Older version: The Human Footprint (HFP) map measures the human influence on the earth's land surface in terms of a Human Influence Index (HII) normalized by biome and realm. Human Footprint values range from 1 to 100. A score of 1 indicates that the grid cell is part of the 1% least influenced area in its biome. The HII map was created from nine global data layers covering human population pressure (population density, population settlements), human land use and infrastructure (built up areas, nighttime lights, land use/land cover), and human access (coastlines, roads, railroads, navigable rivers). A third map product, The Last of the Wild, highlights the remaining 10% least influenced areas by biome or ecoregion. Version 2 of the maps were published in 2005 by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).

### Global Human Modification (2015)

The global Human Modification map provides a cumulative measure of human modification of terrestrial lands across the globe at a 1-km2 resolution. It is a continuous 0-1 metric that reflects the proportion of a landscape modified based on modeling the physical extents of 13 anthropogenic stressors and their estimated impacts using spatially-explicit global datasets with a median year of 2016.

### Low Impact Areas (2015)

The Low Impact Areas dataset uses open-access, frequently updated data sets on terrestrial human impacts (human population density, built-up area, cropland, livestock, forest cover change, roads, night-time lights) to create a new categorical map of global human influence ("Low Impact Areas" and "Very Low Impact Areas") at a 1-km2 resolution.

### Canada Human Access (2010)

Global Forest Watch Canada's Human Access dataset is current to circa 2010. Human access is the combined land surface anthropogenic disturbances caused mainly by industrial activities, which include, but are not limited to, roads, mines, clearcuts, wellsites, pipelines, transmission lines, and agricultural clearings. All disturbances (i.e., access) were buffered by 500 metres. The Canada Access 2010 dataset was created as the initial step in creating the Canada IFL maps.

### Boreal Ecosystem Anthropogenic Disturbance (2010, 2015)

Boreal ecosystem anthropogenic disturbance (BEAD) layers for Canada. A vector disturbance dataset of unbuffered individual linear and polygonal disturbance types covering 51 caribou ranges in Canada. The dataset is based on 2008-2010 Landsat 5 imagery and each disturbance type was also gridded to a 1 km<sup>2</sup> resolution and represent total km<sup>2</sup>/km<sup>2</sup> for polygonal disturbances and km/km<sup>2</sup> for linear disturbances. In total, nineteen individual raster layers were produced including layers representing total polygonal and linear disturbances. The dataset was updated for some ranges in 2012 and 500m buffers were applied. More recently, the dataset was updated for all ranges in 2015 using 30-m and 15-m Landsat 8 imagery from 2015-2017.

### Anthropogenic Biomes

Note: Description needs to be updated to reflect latest datasets.

Anthropogenic biomes (anthromes) characterize the human-altered form and dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems14. They denote long-term patterns in human populations and their land use, taking into account population density, agricultural village development, percentage cover by crops, pasture and rice, irrigated land area and areas potentially covered by trees52,53. Anthromes version 2 data were calculated using a 100 km2 equal area hexagonal discrete global grid format. For presentation, we grouped anthromes as either low intensity or high intensity to show differences in use between Indigenous Peoples’ and other lands. Remote rangelands, remote woodlands, inhabited treeless and barren lands, wild woodlands and wild treeless and barren lands anthromes were classified as low intensity; urban, dense settlement, rice village, irrigated village, rainfed village, pastoral village, residential irrigated croplands, residential rainfed croplands and populated croplands were classified as high intensity.

Anthropogenic Biomes. From The Encyclopedia of Earth: "Anthropogenic biomes describe globally-significant ecological patterns within the terrestrial biosphere caused by sustained direct human interaction with ecosystems, including agriculture, urbanization, forestry and other land uses. Conventional biomes, such as tropical rainforests or grasslands, are based on global vegetation patterns related to climate. Now that humans have fundamentally altered global patterns of ecosystem form, process, and biodiversity, anthropogenic biomes provide a contemporary view of the terrestrial biosphere in its human-altered form. Anthropogenic biomes may also be termed "anthromes" to distinguish them from conventional biome systems, or "human biomes" (a simpler but less precise term)". The three wildland categories (wild forest, sparse trees, and barren) are of primary interest.
