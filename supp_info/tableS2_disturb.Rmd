####Table S2. Examples of recent remote sensing based disturbance datasets from Canada

Several disturbance datasets have been developed recently, some of which have been used to update both the Canada and Global IFL datasets. The datasets represent changes in forest cover with or without attribution to disturbance type.

**Global maps of forest cover change (Hansen et al. 2013).** The maps were developed using Landsat imagery at a resolution of 30m and covers latitudes 80°N and 60°S. Four metrics are used: (i) percent tree cover in 2000, (ii) cover loss 2000-2012, (iii) cover gain 2000-2012, and (iv) year of cover loss. There is no attribution of disturbance type. The datasets was recently updated to 2015.

**Boreal ecosystem anthropogenic disturbance (BEAD) layers for Canada (Pasher et al. 2013).** A vector disturbance dataset of unbuffered individual linear and polygonal disturbance types covering 51 caribou ranges in Canada. The dataset is based on 2008-2010 Landsat imagery and each disturbance type was also gridded to a 1 km2 resolution and represent total km2/km2 for polygonal disturbances and km/km2for linear disturbances. In total, nineteen individual raster layers were produced including layers representing total polygonal and linear disturbances. The dataset was updated for some ranges in 2012 and 500m buffers were applied.

**Annual mapping of large forest disturbances in Canada (Guindon et al. 2014).** Annual mapping of large forest disturbances across Canada's forests using 250m MODIS imagery from 2000 to 2011. At total of 22 raster maps were generated representing fractional change and disturbance type. Fractional change is mapped as a continuous variable at the pixel level. Disturbance types were classified as no-change, fire, harvesting, or flooding.

**Satellite forest monitoring in Canada (White et al. 2017).** Online satellite-derived forest change map for Canada with information on the amount, type, and rates of disturbances from 1985-2011. The maps were developed using Landsat imagery at a resolution of 30m and estimate change type as being fire, infrastructure, harvest, or untyped.

**Alberta Human Footprint (ABMI 2017).** From the ABMI website: "This comprehensive layer (updated every two years) includes human footprint information related to the energy, forestry, and agriculture industries, as well as urban development. The ABMI's human footprint information is core to understanding relationships between human land use, habitat, and species abundance. These data are used to support policy development, regional planning, and cumulative effects management decisions." The Human Footprint Index (HFI) has being developed for 2007, 2010, 2012, 2014.
